My goal is to improve your fluency to a point where you feel comfortable living, continuing your studies or working in Sweden. Our textbook readings will be centered around 5 different themes; crime and punishment, social media, holidays, consumerism and networking/job seeking. In addition to the textbook, we will read the novel Andr\u00c3\u00a9es ballongf\u00c3\u00a4rd. You will be responsible for creating your own vocab lists at this level, as well as keeping a reading journal with thoughts on your readings. We will discuss your readings in class, but now without the guidance of questions and reading packets, etc. from previous courses. The focus will as always be on your speaking skills and we will use a variety of other course materials as well to maximize our speaking activities. With a very low number of students signed up this semester, take advantage of the personalized instruction and the speaking opportunities a class with only a few students offer!", "completed": false, "prereq_count": 0}], "links": []}
