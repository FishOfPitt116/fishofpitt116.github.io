From kissing to romantic escapades, from Paris to the Riviera, from Tahiti to Marrakesh, France and the Francophone world have a highly recognizable profile in matters of sex and love. Sexual behavior is always culturally inflected, and it evolves through time in its creation of emotions, attachments, families and institutions. In this class, we will adopt a historical lens to retrace the cultural transformations of sex and love in the French cultural and social landscape. We will study contemporary visual and textual materials (especially film), and a variety of historical documents from the Middle Ages to the present day. We will address controversial issues such as virginity, adultery, same-sex relationships, women's sexual agency, gender definitions through sexuality, the shifting boundaries of pornography and other related matters.

In this course, we will consider key cultural products, perspectives, and practices around the concept of gender broadly conceived, including masculinity, feminism, hetero/homosexuality, transgenre, and others. Questions of nation, race, and ethnicity will factor into our discussions as well, and we will think often about the words or language that texts employ to talk about gender. We will also engage in cross-cultural comparison between France and our own cultural context(s) to give us comparative insight into the world we live in. We will treat questions such as: What is the current 'crisis' in French masculinity? What does it mean to be a man today in France? What is the current state of feminism in France, and how does it differ from previous incarnations? How does the discourse of homosexuality and queerness compare to the US context? What does transgenre signify? When and how did transgenre appear as a category in France? How are French constructs of gender inflected with Arab or North African identities? What other recurring forms of intersectionality are there? And how is all this represented in cultural texts? Our focus will be French culture since the turn of the century. Taking an interdisciplinary cultural studies approach, this is not a literature course per se (though we will read some literature).
