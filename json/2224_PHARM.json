Via the utilization of real-world evaluations and marketing materials, topics covered will include general mechanisms of action for drugs, what happens to a drug after administration, sources of variability in drug response, the legality and ethics of the pharmaceutical development process, and the marketing of drugs to the public. Principles of pharmacology will be reviewed with focus on the multidisciplinary process of how a drug moves from discovery through FDA approval in order to be introduced to the public for everyday use. While this course may be of particular interest to students studying biology, chemistry, mathematics, data science, healthy policy, public health, and other health science programs, it may also appeal to students interested in a variety of disciplines, including ethics, marketing, and law. All students are welcome.", "completed": false, "prereq_count": 0}], "links": []}
