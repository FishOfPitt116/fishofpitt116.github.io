This course introduces students to socio-legal theory related to the nature of crime, criminalization, and the purpose of punishment in the American criminal justice system. We use theory to explore and evaluate the workings of criminal justice institutions in a broader societal context, including how criminal justice compares with other institutions of social control/welfare (e.g. the education system). We also learn and apply major approaches to law & society in order to interrogate broader issues concerning law's intersection with societal values, power, and inequality.

That \"justice is blind\" is a central value and claim of criminal justice institutions, and modern legal systems more generally. This course takes a mainly historical approach to examine the overt and subtle ways that this blindness has been compromised by being commodified, gendered, and racialized. In terms of overt class boundaries, this 'blindness' emerged with the rise of the nation-state, but it was long gendered and racialized in overt ways and commodified in more subtle ones. Since roughly the 1960s, the U.S. has been in an era where all three social boundaries impinge on law's blindness in ways that tend to be more subtle than overt. Using a social boundary approach, students in this course will learn these historical trajectories to the present as a foundation for thinking critically about criminal justice, the legal system, and contemporary social inequality more generally. A major focus is law's relationship to inequalities based on race, class, and gender. Topics covered include slavery, Jim Crow, the development of formal equality under the law, affirmative action, and the commodification of legal rights.", "completed": false, "prereq_count": 0}, {"dept_code": "LCJS", "id": "1100", "course_title": "CRIMINOLOGY", "description": "Enrollment Alert: Effective Spring 2022, this course replaces ADMJ 0600 INTRODUCTION TO CRIMINOLOGY.
