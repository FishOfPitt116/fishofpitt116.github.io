Section III will analyze the fundamental metaphysics and ethics of Amerindian myth and ritual. Section IV will examine literary works and films that provide critical insights to contemporary philosophies of spirituality and healing, and, as the arts usually do, connect these insights to a sundry array of contemporary issues, opening up unexpected vistas.

By critically engaging with the cultural specificities of local Latinx communities through community-engaged learning, we will develop a theoretical and experiential understanding of the continuities and discontinuities that characterize their relationship with Latin America and Spain. We will pay close attention to how their experiences and encounters with different rural and urban settings have shaped Latinxs' understanding of national belonging to the United States, Latin America, and the Spanish-speaking world at large.
