What is gender? What is sexuality? How are these concepts related to culture? To nature? To help you answer these important questions, this course will introduce you to the exciting field of gender and sexuality studies. We will use a range of interdisciplinary concepts, tools, and methods to understand and analyze sex, gender, femininity, masculinity, and sexuality. Through readings, multimedia, and class discussion, we will study how gender and sexuality are socially and culturally constructed. In addition, we will consider how gender intersects with other identity categories such as race, class, ethnicity, nation, age, ability, and sexuality. Because we all have a gender and a sexuality, this course is crucial for any profession and for understanding the world around us. Taught in discussion-based sections, it is also a great opportunity for you to develop your written and oral skills. Also, you will learn to apply the critical vocabulary used in gender studies to other fields of study. The course is open to all students regardless of background and has no pre-requisite. As a prerequisite for more advanced courses in the GSWS program and as the intro course for current or future students in the GSWS major and minor, this course will prepare you for more advanced coursework.

While popular culture is dismissed by some as merely a mass consumer culture, others acknowledge that contemporary popular cultural forms may, in keeping with a history of once contemporary popular art, culture, and literature (e.g. Dickens, Warhol, etc.) Come to be understood as essential, canonical and elite. Ultimately, these materials may be read as a texts that inform our understanding of culture and social life and prompt such questions as: how does popular culture (re)construct our sense of \"ordinary\" life as something extraordinary? Why are some cultural forms dismissed and others more readily accepted? What social processes bring cultural forms into the public domain? This course will examine popular culture in a variety of forms such as: music, art, television, collectibles, internet, and social media. Students will consider examples from Western, non-Western, and \"global\" culture, but will use sex and sexuality, gender, and ideas of race to understand the relationship between popular culture, material culture, representation, and consumerism, and power and resistance. It will also address these phenomenon over time.

The goal of this course is to assist students in developing an understanding of the ways in which science has constructed our understanding of gender and sexuality since the nineteenth century, as well as the lived experiences of people within the scientific community who shape and navigate these concepts. To accomplish this goal, we will apply feminist theory, including feminist critiques of the history of medicine, psychology, and science, and gender theory, to an investigation of the evolution of scientific knowledge regarding gender and sexuality, as well as race, disability, and health. We will also explore the ways in which people, especially women, people of color, and transpeople have interacted with technology, shaped scientific discourse. In each course lecture and discussion, we will focus on a broad range of scientific fields, discourses, and narratives to construct a comprehensive understanding of the scientific knowledge and identity in the modern world.

While we will focus on the United States, there will be some engagement with global feminist perspectives on gender, race, class, and sexuality. In keeping with the activist nature of feminist theory, this course will approach 'theory' as attempts to answer fundamental questions about the power relations that structure our everyday lives and consciousness. Theory in this sense is a tool for thinking systematically about how the world works, and for constructing arguments about how it should work. Consequently, we will pay particular attention to the (de)construction of power in both public and private relations as we critically analyze texts, discuss and present ideas in class, and complete written analyses.

By 1945, the majority of women in Europe had been enfranchised, yet as women demanded to exercise the rights of citizenship, they frequently faced limitations upon their rights as citizens based on gender. This course charts the ways in which women have adapted to and attempted to challenge the ideological, political and material conditions of citizenship in modern Europe. Topics to be examined include: women's political activism; citizenship and warfare; consumer citizenship; sexuality and reproductive rights; and citizenship within the context of multicultural society. Classes are arranged both chronologically and thematically, and will combine contextual lectures, seminars, and presentations in order to facilitate discussion. The course is organized around three key themes: Women, Regulation and the State; Gender Discourses; and Citizenship and Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Activism. Each of these themes is designed to allow students to engage with a wide array of historical and contemporary sources including: personal narratives, political essays, representations of women in art, fiction, and the contemporary media, and a variety of field studies based in London.", "completed": false}, {"dept_code": "GSWS", "id": "1900", "course_title": "INTERNSHIP", "description": "An opportunity to extend academic training to a practical work experience in an area where the student has gained some expertise.", "completed": false}], "links": [{"source": "0100", "target": "1140"}]}
