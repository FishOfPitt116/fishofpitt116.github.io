The course address the historical shifts in the cultural understanding of gender roles, class belonging, consumption habits and expectations, the international circulation of craftmanship and celebrities, and technological innovation. We will start addressing the anthropology of body ornamentation, gender markings and the difference between costume and fashion. Our historical point of departure is the grand arrival of Catherine De Medici from Florence to Paris in 1547, following her marriage to King Henry II of France. We then follow the progressive establishment of Paris as the capital of European (and eventually international) fashion, together with Italian cities like Florence, Venice and Milan. We also take a significant detour through London during the \"dandy\" era of the early 19th century and the \"mod\" and \"punk\" trends of the decades between 1960 and 1980. Punk leads us into a discussion of current international \"anti-fashion\" trends, such as the politics and economics of privilege, cheap labor and environmental concerns about \"fast fashion.\" This course is taught in English. *This course may be used for the Italian Studies major (whether listed as FR 0090 or ITAL 0090), but does not count for the Italian major or the Italian minor.", "completed": false}, {"dept_code": "ITAL", "id": "0101", "course_title": "ITALIAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE 1", "description": "An introduction to the Italian language, including basic grammar, vocabulary and speech patterns.

Part II invites students to engage with the diversity of Italian regions-their languages, cultures, and sub-national identities-through a representative set of regional case studies. Finally, in Part III students will explore the nature of italianit\u00e0 (Italianness) as represented both in the diasporic movement of Italians around the world, and in current debates over immigration to Italy and the rights of immigrants-children-born in Italy-- to enjoy the benefits of Italian citizenship.", "completed": false}, {"dept_code": "ITAL", "id": "1087", "course_title": "FASCISM AND RESISTANCE", "description": "The \"ventennio nero\" (or black twenty years; 1922-1943) refers to the period of Italy's Fascist rule under strongman Benito Mussolini, Fascism's founder.

This class, taught in English, explores the history, politics, and cultural underpinnings of what Susan Sontag called \"fascinating Fascism\"; its construction of masculinity and the idealized \"Fascist mother\"; its invention of a Fascist Mediterranean \"race\" to rival the Aryan race of Nazi Germany; its pursuit of an Empire that would be a worthy heir to Rome; and finally, the robust resistance culture that rose up to counter it.", "completed": false}, {"dept_code": "ITAL", "id": "1092", "course_title": "ITALIAN TRANSLATION WORKSHOP: FROM THEORY TO BEST PRACTICES", "description": "Tradurre, tradire.

This course examines translation from both a theoretical and practical perspective, allowing students to understand the ways in which translation has been formulated, promoted, and criticized, but also giving them a laboratory for the translation of texts of various kinds and genres, including letters, oral histories, publicity materials, literature, and even film subtitles. Students in this class will move from short translation exercises to longer translation projects, culminating in a multi-piece portfolio of their translation projects, which will draw on untranslated materials from local archives and library collections.
