Among the principal themes that the readings and discussions focus on are: pre-history of Africa and the genesis of humankind; the complexity of migration, and state formation; and African and European earlier contact. A fundamental approach will be to look at Africa from the inside out and to analyze African societies from the perspective of their internal development and reaction to external influences.

It takes as its particular focus the persistence of urban residential segregation as a key structural lynchpin of American race relations and inequality. Relying on scholarly and historical sources and films, we will analyze the ways the racialization of urban space produces inequities in housing, employment, education, social welfare policy, policing, and redevelopment.

Recently, scholars of religion have demonstrated that religious identities are often racialized as well. In this course, we will discover that religion and race are both modern categories rooted in post-enlightenment ideas about what it means to be human. We will see how the establishment of these religious and racial categories led to new hierarchies and inequalities. We will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion and race, and how their ideas played a role in European imperialism. We will also investigate how the discipline of religious studies has developed its analytical tools with a racialized understanding of religion. The course will examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and consider the political ramifications of these examples. In particular, we will think about the impact of white supremacy on black religion in the united states, the complicated relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia, and contemporary Islamophobia in the US.
