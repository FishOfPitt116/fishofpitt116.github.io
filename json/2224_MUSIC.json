The purpose of this class is to transform your experience with music by focusing on live performance. Music is a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives, so much so that many people have lost the ability to listen critically to what they are hearing. In many contexts, we are not even aware that music is playing until it is brought to our attention! Recorded music accounts for much of this ubiquity and it's also changed many listeners' relationship with music. Throughout the semester, we will explore the experience of listening to live performances of music, which may include large ensembles, chamber ensembles, solo concerts, and multi-media performances. Topics will include protocol and traditions of the audience, criteria for critical listening, and discrimination of basic elements of performance. Students will attend live performances, consider evaluative criteria for music performances, and develop critical listening skills. We will also have opportunities to speak with performers to learn about various ways of experiencing music. We are interested in developing critical skills to experience, analyze, and appreciate the myriad musical styles and contexts you will encounter over a lifetime of listening. To that end, this class is focused totally on the act of critical, experiential listening, how to do it, informed listening, and what it can tell the listener's not only about a piece of music, but about the culture and society that created that music, as well as the challenges faced by the increasing ubiquity of music in our world.
