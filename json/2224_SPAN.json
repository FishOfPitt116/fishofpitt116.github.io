Departing from the contention that the relations between drug trafficking networks, governmental responses to the drug trade, drug production and consumption, are not clear and transparent as depicted in dominant discourses exemplified by the narrative of the War on Drugs, this course analyzes narco-culture not as a simplistic response centered merely on the idolization of drug lords or drug culture, but as a dynamic creative current that tries to make sense of the complexity and violence of the world of drugs. Why do official narratives of capitalist enterprise disavow the capitalist foundation of the drug trade? How are discourses of security and protection ironically embodied in violent militarized actions and neo-imperial ventures? How does the criminalization of certain cultural practices and symbols - particular languages, dress codes, music - relate to the racialization and sexualization of certain peoples and bodies? Moreover, how can we understand the (global) commercial success of narco-culture as exemplified by recent mainstream media and popular culture? In this course, we will address these questions by engaging in close reading/viewing of contemporary Latin American films that center on representations and (re)productions of narco-culture. These primary works will be examined in conjunction with secondary readings that discuss topics relevant to our analysis of narco-culture, such as globalization, neoliberal capitalism, immigration, femicides, cultural appropriation, and racial and gender construction.", "completed": false, "prereq_count": 1}, {"dept_code": "SPAN", "id": "1423", "course_title": "SEXUAL DIVERSITY IN LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE", "description": "This course covers ways in which sexuality is constructed in Latin American cultural texts (novels, short fiction, poetry, printed media, theater, film and popular culture) from the late nineteenth to early twenty-first century.", "completed": false, "prereq_count": 1}, {"dept_code": "SPAN", "id": "1435", "course_title": "POETICS OF BILINGUALISM", "description": "Concentrating on what is bilingualism, and after reviewing its historical and cultural parameters in Latin America, we will study the violent encounter between the Indigenous languages and the languages brought by the Conquistadores (Spanish, English, French, Portuguese), and its impact on the formation of the nation, class relations, race and language.

In an age of a global environmental crisis, we turn to our own cultural production to make sense of nature, to wonder whether we can survive it, or whether it can survive us. Literature explores whether humans can achieve harmony with nature, questions what, if any, of our most human, most artificial trappings can coexist with the natural world. Environment has shaped the cultural production-and vice versa- of Latin America and the global reaches of the former Spanish empire. From the aquatic engineering that made the city of M\u00e9xico-Tenochtitl\u00e1n possible and Spanish colonizers' aspirations of earthly paradise to the 21st-century climate migrants of the Dry Corridor of Central America and the hurricanes of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico and tsunamis of the Philippines, the persistent tension between humans and nature spans centuries and continents. In this course, we will trace the depiction of nature and the environment as well as environmental issues in global Hispanic literature and cultural production (to include visual art, music, and performance).

Students will be exposed to topics across four overarching themes: adolescence, reproduction, illness, and aging, with subtopics such as sexuality, sexual orientation, gender identities in relation to transgender and intersex issues, pregnancy, infertility, breast cancer, menopause, and eating disorders, among others. At the same time, students will be exposed to a broader geographical and historical panorama by examining the relationship between women's health issues to the political and cultural issues of different countries in the Hispanic world. Based on these particular contexts, communities, and identities, we will try to answer the question why these women's issues happened in those regions and within specific communities.
