From kissing to romantic escapades, from Paris to the Riviera, from Tahiti to Marrakesh, France and the Francophone world have a highly recognizable profile in matters of sex and love. Sexual behavior is always culturally inflected, and it evolves through time in its creation of emotions, attachments, families and institutions. In this class, we will adopt a historical lens to retrace the cultural transformations of sex and love in the French cultural and social landscape. We will study contemporary visual and textual materials (especially film), and a variety of historical documents from the Middle Ages to the present day. We will address controversial issues such as virginity, adultery, same-sex relationships, women's sexual agency, gender definitions through sexuality, the shifting boundaries of pornography and other related matters.

This course will take a historical perspective to French cinema and to our sense of what French cinema is. We'll track how French society has changed along with its cultures of making and consuming images, and we'll see how French films of the past can help us better understand the media-saturated present in which we live. Along the way, we'll look at silent films, classical-era sound films, films from the New Wave period, and contemporary films in a variety forms, including documentary, the musical, horror, art cinema, the essay film, postcolonial cinema, digital media, and much more. No previous course experience with cinema is presumed.

We will start addressing the anthropology of body ornamentation, gender markings and the difference between costume and fashion. Our historical point of departure is the grand arrival of Catherine De Medici from Florence to Paris in 1547, following her marriage to King Henry II of France. We then follow the progressive establishment of Paris as the capital of European (and eventually international) fashion, together with Italian cities like Florence, Venice and Milan. We also take a significant detour through London during the \"dandy\" era of the early 19th century and the \"mod\" and \"punk\" trends of the decades between 1960 and 1980.
