They are also among the most enduring, although they have only been unearthed in the last 200 years. In this course, we read myths from ancient Mesopotamia, Ugarit, and Israel. We study the myths as literary works, representative of the ideas and issues of the original cultural context in which they were shaped. These myths offer insight into the religious mentality of the ancient Near East, as well as societal and political issues. We examine themes such as the presentation of the life of the gods, the relationship between the human and divine worlds, the issues of mortality and immortality, existence, fertility, kingship, and ethics. The primary goal of this course is to better understand these myths as they existed and developed in their ancient settings. Of course, because the myths are expressions of human thought, we may find that in studying them we also come to better understand ourselves.", "completed": false, "prereq_count": 0}, {"dept_code": "RELGST", "id": "0105", "course_title": "RELIGIONS OF THE WEST", "description": "This course is a historical introduction to the religious traditions that developed in ancient Near East and the Mediterranean.

Throughout the course, we also examine interactions among these religious traditions and will make use of documentary film and sacred art to illustrate. In the final segment of the course we examine the issue of secularization and the rise of the category of the non-believer, or \"none.\" The course also serves as an introduction to the academic study of religion and provides a foundation for further coursework in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

It integrates two intertwined themes: (1) early Islamic empires as geopolitical formations; and (2) the development of ideas - from ritual to philosophy to law. The first centuries of Islam are fascinating for many of the same reasons they are complex and even controversial: Surviving primary sources are fragmented, partisan, and often retrospective; a tremendous range of voices competed to define the new religion; and nearly all subsequent Muslim thinkers would harken back to this period to legitimize their own positions. The central goal is to develop an understanding of the diversity of voices in this early period and consider why certain conceptualizations of religion displaced others; and then follow those voices beyond the Arabian Peninsula to examine manifestations in the North African and Central Asian borderlands.", "completed": false, "prereq_count": 0}, {"dept_code": "RELGST", "id": "0505", "course_title": "RELIGION IN ASIA", "description": "This course serves as an introduction to the major religious traditions of South and East Asia.

We approach these traditions through lectures and discussion based on Chinese classical and popular literature, secondary scholarship, and films, which inform us about cultural and historical context, beliefs, practices, and personal experience.

In particular, we will explore how the close relationship between European imperialism and scientific institutions created new parameters for conversations about Hindu and Buddhist traditions.

We also consider the dynamics of the \"monotheistic\" revolution of Akhenaton. In the historical and cultural context of ancient Egypt, students encounter the interaction of sacred and secular, and the relationship between state cults and private worship by nobles and commoners alike.

We define \"diaspora\" as the spread and dispersal of people of African descent, both forced and voluntary, through the slave trade, imperial and colonial displacements, and postcolonial migrations. In what form do African religious expressions exist in the African Diaspora communities? This course exposes students to the indigenous African foundations of the religious beliefs and religious practices of African communities living in the Diaspora. Students will receive historical, ethnographical, and anthropological approaches to grasp the essence of these non-doctrinaire and non-textual religions focused on a rich memory of African deities, rituals, morality and practices that have been passed from generation to generation. Because most of the Africans forced to migrate to the New World as slaves came from West Africa, this course will provide students with insights into the beliefs and practices of the \"Yoruba Religions\" also known as the \"Afro-Atlantic religions\" such as Santeria in Cuba; Vodou in Haiti; Shango in Trinidad and Grenada; Candomblan Brazil among others. Topics to be covered in this course will include sources of African religious beliefs, African theological notions about God and the Universe, African conceptions about the nature of the human being, witchcraft and the problem of Evil in African religious thought and practice, illness, health, death, and ancestor worship. Furthermore, we will also pay close attention to less known Afro-American cults and religions containing Amerindian mythology and shamanism that emphasize divination, healing, and spirit mediumship such as: the Maria Lionza cult in Venezuela, The Palo Monte in Cuba, and the Garifuna Dugu in Central America. A special feature of the course will include the analysis of \"spirit possession\" as a common denominator to African-derived religions as well as a relevant keystone in transmission dynamics.

Recently, scholars of religion have demonstrated that religious identities are often racialized as well. In this course, we will discover that religion and race are both modern categories rooted in post-enlightenment ideas about what it means to be human. We will see how the establishment of these religious and racial categories led to new hierarchies and inequalities. We will discuss how post-enlightenment thinkers linked religion and race, and how their ideas played a role in european imperialism. We will also investigate how the discipline of religious studies has developed its analytical tools with a racialized understanding of religion. The course will examine case studies in which religion has been racialized, and consider the political ramifications of these examples. In particular, we will think about the impact of white supremacy on black religion in the united states, the complicated relationship between antisemitism and islamophobia, and contemporary islamophobia in the us.

Lectures in this course will aim to explore the means by which international conflict and violence involving these (and other) actors is bound by the tenets, institutions, or characteristics of Islam. These investigations will include inroads into a well-framed understanding of the recent increase in the presence and/or influence of Islamic political movements and the rising influence of international Islamic political parties in each of the aforementioned geographic locale. Course investigations will simultaneously explore the growing trend towards the transnational movement of goods, ideas, and peoples spurred on by or otherwise connected to the ideological tenets of contemporary Islam. The focus within these investigative pursuits will be on connective, global, and conceptual themes within seemingly disparate political movements and actors. Conceptual themes to be investigated include, but are not limited to the structures of global capitalism, economic inequality, gender inequality, minority rights, human rights, colonialism and imperialism, democracy and governance, modernity versus traditionalism, and secularism versus religiosity.

Particular attention is paid to the problems of transmission of thought and practices from one culture to another and to the ways in which Buddhism changed to meet those challenges and make itself relevant to the members of East Asian societies.

Part two offers concrete examples of Buddhist modernism by illustrating how Buddhist contemplative practices and doctrines such as sati have been reinterpreted and reformulated in modern psychology. Part three examines how a Japanese Zen practitioner's presentation of Zen compares with psychotherapeutic perspectives on it.

In fact, the reverse is true: from Taiwan and Hong Kong through mainland China, increasing prosperity is resulting in an increased \"investment\" in religion. In addition to the study of religious ideas, practices, and institutions in premodern China, the course ends by looking at contemporary beliefs and practices and issues of politics, class, and gender. Our purpose is to gain some exposure to Chinese religious thought and practice, to identify dominant themes underlying Chinese values and behavior, and to explore the syncretic nature of religion in China as each tradition finds expression in and comes to influence other aspects of Chinese religion and culture.
