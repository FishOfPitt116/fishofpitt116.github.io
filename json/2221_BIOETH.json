This upper-level seminar focuses on the issues surrounding environmental sustainability in Latin America from a holistic, interdisciplinary perspective. The course will start with a general introduction to the three legs of sustainability and sustainable development theory, as well as the ecology and evolution of Neotropical biodiversity. We will use published primary literature to explore the particular complexities of Latin American sustainable development, and analyze case studies of moments through history in which environmental issues were either championed or de-emphasized. The course will feature several guest lectures, optional seminars for extra credit, and discussions of current sustainability news. Students will be responsible for a final research project and presentation.", "completed": false, "prereq_count": 0}], "links": []}
