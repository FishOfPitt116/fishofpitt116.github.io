It investigates privacy in the digital world from cultural, social, communication, and policy perspectives. Taking a comparative approach, privacy related to digital communication is compared across several global regions in an attempt to understand the distinctiveness of privacy in those regions. The course will first introduce students to the concepts of privacy, the digital age, and the relation between privacy protections and the state. Students will understand the significance of the issue of digital privacies and why we need to employ a comparative approach to examine it. The course will then look at selected case studies of digital privacy in several global regions, including the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and South East Asia. Issues related to digital privacies such as Internet laws and policies, media regulations and public interest, data protection, state control, and commercial interests in the digital age, surveillance, copyright, and privacy advocates will also be included.", "completed": false}], "links": []}
