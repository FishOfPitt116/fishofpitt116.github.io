Early ideas of the atom, Newton's laws of motion, heat and energy, electromagnetic waves and light are discussed. This is followed by modern ideas of space and time as explained by Einstein's famous theories as well as current ideas about our Universe and cosmology. The course concludes by addressing current ideas about the quantum world. The course contains trace amounts of Math.
